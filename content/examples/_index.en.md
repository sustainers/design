Theory is great, but sometimes you really just need to see it to understand it. This theme focuses on tools, design frameworks, or other examples from real-world projects and communities. The purpose of including case studies is to help someone move past that challenging step of theoretical understanding and conceptualization, to actually doing it in their own project or community.
