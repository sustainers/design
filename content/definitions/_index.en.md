When we say design, what exactly do we mean? What is the vocabulary behind design, its key concepts, and how this take shape in open communities? Depending on who you ask, everyone seems to have a different perception on this question, and there is probably some truth in all of these different responses. Most notably though, this is helpful to dispel the myth that "design" only means graphic design, making logos and pretty images, etc.
